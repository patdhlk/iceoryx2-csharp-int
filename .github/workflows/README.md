# GitHub Workflows

## build.yml

This workflow builds the iceoryx2-csharp project and creates
NuGet packages (coming soon).

### Workflow Steps

1. **Build Native Library** (Multi-platform)

   - Runs on: Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
   - Checks out the repository with submodules
   - Sets up Rust toolchain
   - Builds the iceoryx2 C FFI library in release mode
   - Uploads native libraries as artifacts for each platform

2. **Build .NET Library**

   - Downloads all native libraries from the previous step
   - Sets up .NET 8.0 and 9.0
   - Restores dependencies
   - Builds the solution in Release configuration
   - Runs tests
   - Uploads build artifacts

3. **Create NuGet Packages**

   - Downloads native libraries
   - Creates NuGet packages for:
     - iceoryx2 (main library)
     - iceoryx2.Reactive (reactive extensions)
   - Packages include native libraries for all platforms
   - Uploads packages as artifacts

4. **Publish to NuGet** (only on tags)
   - Automatically publishes packages when a tag is pushed
   - Requires `NUGET_API_KEY` secret to be configured

### Triggers

- **Push** to `main` branch
- **Pull requests** to `main` branch
- **Manual trigger** via workflow_dispatch

### Secrets Required

For automatic publishing to NuGet.org:

- `NUGET_API_KEY`: Your NuGet.org API key

### Artifacts

The workflow produces the following artifacts:

- `native-linux-x64`: Linux native library
- `native-osx-x64`: macOS native library
- `native-win-x64`: Windows native library
- `dotnet-build`: Compiled .NET assemblies
- `nuget-packages`: NuGet package files (.nupkg)

### Usage

The workflow runs automatically on push and pull requests. To manually trigger:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in GitHub
2. Select "Build and Package" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the branch and click "Run workflow"

### Publishing a Release

To publish a new version to NuGet.org:

1. Update version numbers in:

   - `src/Iceoryx2/Iceoryx2.csproj`
   - `src/Iceoryx2.Reactive/Iceoryx2.Reactive.csproj`

2. Commit and push changes

3. Create and push a tag:

   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

4. The workflow will automatically build and publish to NuGet.org
